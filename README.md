# Go Yeelight

A GO package that implements Yeelight WiFi Light Inter-Operation Specification. 

This code will find Yeelight lamp connected in LAN using Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP), and send commands via Telnet Protocol.

This package is heavily based on goupnp SSDP implementation. Thanks guys :)
